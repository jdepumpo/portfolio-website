title: 'In the Beginning: Hello World'
---
I got my start at a summer camp in sixth grade where I wrote my first <code>Hello World</code> in HTML. To be honest, I was a little underwhelmedâ€”all of that for two words? In Arial font? No thanks.

It wasn't until the next day of camp when I found some copypasta JavaScript on a forum to <span class="underline decoration-orange-500 decoration-wavy cursor-context-menu" id="cursor-trigger">add this cursor effect to my page.</span> Staring at the cursor effect, I realized the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <span class="font-medium">I was hooked.</span>
