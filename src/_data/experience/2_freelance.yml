    <li>Developed websites with the <strong>JAM stack and Gatsby framework</strong>, including for a political campaign for the California State Assembly.</li>
    <li>Developed a <strong>UI component library and page templates</strong> and integrating them into the clientâ€™s HubSpot CMS using <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript, and HubL</strong> markup syntax. This was so successful that the client fast-tracked their roll out of Hubspot.</li>
