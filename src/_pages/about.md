### I bring ideas to life on the web by asking the right questions, always learning, and delivering clean, efficient code.

#### My name is Joe DePumpo and I am full-stack web developer looking for an entry-level position to continue developing my skills.

In addition to my years of experience designing and developing static websites, both as a freelancer and in various marketing rolls, I recently graduated from a coding bootcamp in order to focus on honing my backend development abilities working with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, and others. I've worked on a number of projects including:
- Developing a **Rails 7** application that takes advantage of **Hotwire Turbo and Stimulus** to make it easier for you to organize your friends, family, and neighbors to house-sit while you are away from home for an extended period.
- Developing websites with the **JAM stack and Gatsby framework**, including for a political campaign for the California State Assembly.
- Developing a **UI component library and page templates** and integrating them into the client's HubSpot CMS using **HTML, CSS, Javascript, and HubL** markup syntax. This was so successful that the client fast-tracked their roll out of Hubspot.
- Automating a direct mail campaign with **Python** to scrape address data of more than 700 embassies around the world and format according to the delivery countryâ€™s postal standards. The campaign was completed **weeks faster and the return rate was reduced to an unprecedented 0.6%.**

With a background in SaaS marketing, I bring a unique perspective of measuring the needs of clients to make development more impactful. I have a track record of managing projects from A-Z including interfacing with a variety of stakeholders, creative problem solving, and delivering on-time and on-budget. I pride myself on my clear and concise communication skills and history of cross-cultural communication that lead to successful projects.
