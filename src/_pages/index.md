#### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joe, a Full-Stack Web Developer who builds websites and applications with a modern tech stack.

Recently, this has led me to:
- Develop a [**Rails 7** application](/projects/roamhome) with **PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, and Hotwire Turbo and Stimulus** that makes it easier to organize house sitters while you are away from home.
- Develop websites with **JAMstack and the Gatsby framework, WordPress, Drupal, and more**, for a variety of companies and organizations.

My resume and more details about my skills and recent projects are [available here](/resume).
