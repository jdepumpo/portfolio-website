#### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joe, a full-stack developer with a focus on Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tailwind, and PostgreSQL.

Recently, this has led me to:
- Develop a [**Rails 7** application](/projects/extendedaway) with **Hotwire Turbo and Stimulus** that makes it easier to organize house sitters while you are away from home.
- Develop websites with the **JAMstack and Gatsby framework**, including for a political campaign for the California State Assembly.

My resume and more details about my skills and recent projects are [available here](/resume).
