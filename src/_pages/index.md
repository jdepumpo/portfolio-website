#### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joe, a full-stack developer with a focus on Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tailwind, and PostgreSQL.

Recently, that has led me to:
- Developing a **Rails 7** application that takes advantage of **Hotwire Turbo and Stimulus** to make it easier for you to organize your friends, family, and neighbors to house-sit while you are away from home for an extended period.
- Developing websites with the **JAM stack and Gatsby framework**, including for a political campaign for the California State Assembly.

My resume and more details about my skills and recent projects are [available here](/resume).
