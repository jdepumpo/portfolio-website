# I bring ideas to life on the web by asking the right questions, always learning, and delivering clean, efficient code.

## Client-Side

I build client-side applications that strike a balance between the tried and true methods of HTML and CSS and bringing them to life with enhancements like Hotwire, TailwindCSS, and others.

## Backend

I build scalable and maintainable server applications with a focus on Ruby on Rails.
